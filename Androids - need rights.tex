Due to the nature of androids -being so similar to human beings- they need nearly all of the same rights as other people do, in most circumstances. A circumstance which may be common though to androids is that of a slave to a family or person, versus  being free-thinking and acting. This makes their necessity for rights similar to that of a confined AI: not actually needing any, because as a slave it should be its owner's responsibility that the android stays in line. However, when androids are anything other than property to be owned, they are people and as such they need all the same rights that people do except for the rights to basic human needs because they do not have the same basic needs of humans.
