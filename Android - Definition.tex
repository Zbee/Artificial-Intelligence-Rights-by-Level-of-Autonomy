A rigid dichotomy to a confined AI is the notion of a completely unconfined Artificial Intelligence, which means that it has a physical manifestation (a body) as well as the ability to think as freely as a human does: an android. These artificial intelligences are just as smart as other AIs with varying levels of autonomy, but they face essentially zero confinement - they are completely free to do as they please within the laws given them. With bodies of their own and a mind essentially an exact clone of a human's, androids are in actual fact people just as humans are. They can do anything that humans can, and with the precision of a machine.
