A rigid dichotomy to a confined AI is the notion of a completely unconfined Artificial Intelligence, which means that it has a physical manifestation (a body) as well as the ability to think as freely as a human does: an android. These artificial intelligences are just as smart as other AIs with varying levels of autonomy, but they face essentially zero confinement - they are completely free to do as they please within the laws given them.
