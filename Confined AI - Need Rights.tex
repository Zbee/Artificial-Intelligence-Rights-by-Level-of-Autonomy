Due to the nature of the limitations existing for most AIs in this low level of autonomy -confined AIs- there is rather little necessity for most any rights. The rights we maintain as humans and citizens of the United States of America are largely geared towards interacting with others, and with that key idea being removed from the equation there is little need for rights. For example, the right of free speech does not apply much at all, because the AI will essentially only ever communicate with machines or its maintainers.
