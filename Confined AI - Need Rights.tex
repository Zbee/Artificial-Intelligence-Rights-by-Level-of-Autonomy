Due to the nature of the limitations existing for most AIs in this low-level of autonomy -confined AIs- there is rather little necessity for most any rights. The rights we maintain as humans and citizens of the United States of America are largely geared towards interacting with others, and with that key idea being removed from the equation there is little need for rights. For example, the right of free speech does not apply much at all, because the AI will essentially only ever communicate with machines or its maintainers. Because of how limiting the constraints are on confined artificial intelligences, there is essentially no reason for them to be granted any rights as intelligences. They are still sentient beings, but they are so confined and noninteractive that any rights granted would be a waste. The argument can be made that they ought to be treated as humans kept prisoner, but their creation is naught but for helping control other machines in the realm in which they reside.
