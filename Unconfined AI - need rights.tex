The nature of an unconfined Artificial Intelligence is that it can do essentially whatever it pleases, and as it has the same level of thinking and thought as people do, it almost has to has the same rights as humans. In order for these intelligences to be able to contribute successfully to society as other intelligences do (people), they will need many rights. If they are not granted these rights, then we are stifling their contributions as if they are confined AIs; they could contribute great things, but without  rights they could much less. For example, without access the to the right of free speech they could not do what is quite possibly the largest contribution they can offer, which is writing. Without freedom of religion, they would be forced to not really be religious at all, or believe blindly in their creators' religion, which prevents them from exploring that which may disprove or alternatively prove religion.
