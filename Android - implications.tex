With androids having every attribute nearly the exact same as human beings, the implications of maintaining the same rights would also be the same. If androids have the same abilities and freedoms as humans, they can also commit the same atrocities as humans can - only much more efficiently. However, they can also contribute similar amazing things to society. All-in-all, androids having rights would not be an unfortunate thing as they would ultimately behave very similar to human beings.
