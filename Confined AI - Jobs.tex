Because of the nature of Artificial Intelligences and robotics in general, even a single confined AI can fill positions formerly taken up by many individual humans, therefore benefiting society by means of potentially letting those humans possess more meaningful jobs. The job easiest to imagine a confined artificial intelligence in is that of a factory foreman of some kind. Completely confined to the network of machines and robotics operating in a factory, no outside access needed nor desired. They would be confined inside of a computer system, and only have access to other machinery, truly confined; and when this is the situation, certainly there is no need for rights to be granted it.
