Androids, as with rights, can hold all of the same jobs as humans. However, as they are still machine (at least their bodies are) they are particularly apt to fill positions which require greater precision than others. A career very easy to imagine androids doing well in is that of surgery. Surgeons require great precision, knowledge, and steadiness of hand and these are all things an android could be made with. It is commonly suggested that simple robots could fill the position well, but there are anomalies that occur in surgery that if not handled could result in the loss of human life, and a robot could not handle them; but an android could, as they have the adaptability that humans do.
