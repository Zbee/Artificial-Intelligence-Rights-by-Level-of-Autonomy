For any level of autonomy controlled by an artificial intelligence though, there is one large requirement for it to have any real need of rights, especially as many rights as we maintain; and that requirement is this: sentience. An artificial intelligence should be self-aware, able to think as we do, and be able to be differentiated from intelligent programming before it acquires any rights of significance.
