For any level of autonomy controlled by an artificial intelligence though, there is one large requirement for it to have any real need of rights, especially as many rights as we maintain; and that requirement is this: sentience. An artificial intelligence should be self-aware, able to think as we do, and be able to be differentiated from intelligent programming before it acquires any rights of significance. Self-awareness is important to the matter of an intelligence having rights because if one is not aware of oneself, then the intelligence would never seek to better or change itself, therefore not necessarily contributing to society when what drives so many of us is to provide or make a name for ourselves.
