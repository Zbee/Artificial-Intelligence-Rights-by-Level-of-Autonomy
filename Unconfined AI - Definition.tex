The level of autonomy above that of a confined Artificial Intelligence is but a small leap because it is simply that of an unconfined AI. It shares numerous similarities with confined AIs, but is not restricted; an unconfined AI still does not have much in the way of a physical presence, but it is free to do as it pleases as long as the goals it was created with are being achieved.
