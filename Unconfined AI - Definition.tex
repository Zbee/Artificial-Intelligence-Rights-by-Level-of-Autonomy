The level of autonomy above that of a confined Artificial Intelligence is but a small leap because it is simply that of an unconfined AI. It shares numerous similarities with confined AIs, but is not restricted; an unconfined AI still does not have much in the way of a physical presence, but it is free to do as it pleases as long as the goals it was created with are being achieved. Another possibly common manifestation of this level of autonomy in an Artificial Intelligence would be didactic in nature: a teacher; artificially intelligent classrooms could aide in the educating of other beings immensely due to the nature of programs versus physical beings which is that they \textit{can} be two places at once, they could specially adapt to each student's way of learning and essentially create a one-on-one environment.
