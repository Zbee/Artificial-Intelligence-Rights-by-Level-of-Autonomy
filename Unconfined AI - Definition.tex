The level of autonomy above that of a confined Artificial Intelligence is but a small leap because it is simply that of an unconfined AI. It shares numerous similarities with confined AIs, but is not restricted; an unconfined AI still does not have much in the way of a physical presence, but it is free to do as it pleases as long as the goals it was created with are being achieved. These Artificial Intelligences are just as smart as confined AIs and just as smart as people, but they have no bodies; they reside on a computer system and can contribute to society the exact same ways citizens can, aside from that which involves a physical presence. The most common manifestation of this type of intelligence that humans see today are as assistants to super geniuses in TV shows and movies, and that is similar to how they will and do appear in reality as well, only they will not be so indentured to their creator as depicted. Due though to a lack of confinements when compared to lesser levels of autonomy an AI could have, these AIs certainly have need of rights.
