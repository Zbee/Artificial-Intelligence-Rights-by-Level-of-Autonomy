If rights are granted confined Artificial Intelligences with the ideology that they may still contribute to society through anomalous conversation, then there are numerous implications that could occur. For one, the AI may seek to increase the amount of these coincidental conversation, even at the cost of endangering other beings or decreasing efficiency as it could understand that any contributions to society that they can make through these conversations is valued and promoted. Another possible outcome of granting rights to confined AIs is that if they do abuse their positions to further society, then they are responsible for their contributions, but due to their confinement they may not have a positive outlook on other beings and could be problematic members of society if allowed in. If rights are not granted, on the basis that they're meant to stay confined, then those anomalous conversations that arise and lead to unexpected contributions from the AI are the sole responsibility of those charged with making the intelligence confined, as they did not succeed, and efforts can and would be made to further confinement. But, even a small change to an Artificial Intelligence's environment can lead to large changes in potential outcomes.
