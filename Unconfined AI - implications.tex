As unconfined Artificial Intelligences think and act so similarly to people do, and would have need of many of the same rights, the implications of them having those rights could be just as bright as people having rights. When humans gain rights, there is an increase in contributions humans make to society as they suddenly are not being punished in some way for contributing; and as the Human Development Index and the number of rights people have increases for a region, so do many other things such as the region's Gross Domestic Product \cite{akbarkhodabakhshi2011}. With unconfined AIs having the same rights as people do, the implications are nearly the same: if AIs are allowed freedom of speech they can introduce new ideologies, freedom of religion and suddenly religion can be challenged and improved upon more, freedom of assembly and AIs and humans can work together to improve just about anything. There are of course possibly negative implications involved with unconfined AIs have rights though. With the freedom to bear arms, AIs could hack for the detriment of others with little to stop it from happening. However, implications increase -largely for the better- when yet another change is made to their level of autonomy.
