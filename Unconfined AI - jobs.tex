Unconfined Artificial Intelligences can fill all of the same jobs as a confined AI, but they can also fill many more and fill those jobs better. If they possess rights, unconfined AIs can fulfill the roles they have even better than without, because they have no reason to fear significant consequences if they chose to speak out against inefficiencies or wrongs in their workplace. A possibly common manifestation of this level of autonomy in an Artificial Intelligence would be didactic in nature: a teacher; artificially intelligent classrooms could aide in the educating of other beings immensely due to the nature of programs versus physical beings which is that they \textit{can} be two places at once, they could specially adapt to each student's way of learning and essentially create a one-on-one environment.
