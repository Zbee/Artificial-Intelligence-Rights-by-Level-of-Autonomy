Unconfined Artificial Intelligences can fill all of the same jobs as a confined AI, but they can also fill many more and fill those jobs better. If they possess rights, unconfined AIs can fulfill the roles they have even better than without, because they have no reason to fear significant consequences if they chose to speak out against inefficiencies or wrongs in their workplace. A possibly common manifestation of unconfined Artificial Intelligences would be didactic in nature: a teacher; artificially intelligent classrooms could aide in the educating of other beings immensely due to the nature of programs versus physical beings which is that they \textit{can} be two places at once, they could specially adapt to each student's way of learning and essentially create a one-on-one environment. In addition to the vast benefits of one-to-one classrooms, there would also be less of a disconnect between administration and students because these AIs could be developing incredibly thorough and complete reports even as they are teaching - another benefit of being artificial.
