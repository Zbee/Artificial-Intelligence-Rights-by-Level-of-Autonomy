Artificial Intelligences need rights similar to humans' own as they become more and more sophisticated and increasingly like unto average humans in how they think, are unique, and contribute to society. Regardless of their level of autonomy, truly sentient artificially-created intelligences with or without rights will have implications unforeseeable, and offer valuable contributions to society. These Artificial Intelligences are just as smart as confined AIs and just as smart as people, but they have no bodies; they reside on a computer system and can contribute to society the exact same ways citizens can, aside from that which involves a physical presence. The most common manifestation of this type of intelligence that humans see today are as assistants to super geniuses in TV shows and movies, and that is similar to how they will and do appear in reality as well, only they will not be so indentured to their creator as depicted.
