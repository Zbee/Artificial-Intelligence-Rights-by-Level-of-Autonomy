The lowest level of autonomy possible in Artificial Intelligences is one of complete confinement, and no actual physical presence - at least not in the form of a body of any kind: a confined AI. These AIs are merely especially clever programming that reside on computer systems, typically performing menial tasks in an intelligent and efficient way that your average program cannot. In addition to not having a physical representation of themselves, these intelligences also have abundant limitations on what they are able to do, what and who they are permitted to communicate and interact with, and what they have dominion over. The most common manifestation of these limitations will be in the form of the AI having a set list of tasks they ought to perform which they cannot expand upon, no communication outside of their network of hardware, and minimal overall control even over their assigned tasks.
